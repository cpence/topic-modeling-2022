H2A.Z is an evolutionary conserved histone variant involved in transcriptional
          regulation, antisilencing, silencing, and genome stability. The mechanism(s) by which
          H2A.Z regulates these various biological functions remains poorly defined, in part due to
          the lack of knowledge regarding its physical location along chromosomes and the bearing it
          has in regulating chromatin structure. Here we mapped H2A.Z across the yeast genome at an
          approximately 300-bp resolution, using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with tiling
          microarrays. We have identified 4,862 small regions—typically one or two
          nucleosomes wide—decorated with H2A.Z. Those “Z loci” are
          predominantly found within specific nucleosomes in the promoter of inactive genes all
          across the genome. Furthermore, we have shown that H2A.Z can regulate nucleosome
          positioning at the GAL1 promoter. Within HZAD domains, the regions where
          H2A.Z shows an antisilencing function, H2A.Z is localized in a wider pattern, suggesting
          that the variant histone regulates a silencing and transcriptional activation via
          different mechanisms. Our data suggest that the incorporation of H2A.Z into specific
          promoter-bound nucleosomes configures chromatin structure to poise genes for
          transcriptional activation. The relevance of these findings to higher eukaryotes is
          discussed.
