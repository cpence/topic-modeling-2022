Restoration of communication in people with complete motor paralysis—a condition called complete locked-in state (CLIS)—is one of the greatest challenges of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. New findings have recently been presented that bring us one step closer to this goal. However, the validity of the evidence has been questioned: independent reanalysis of the same data yielded significantly different results. Reasons for the failure to replicate the findings must be of a methodological nature. What is the best practice to ensure that results are stringent and conclusive and analyses replicable? Confirmation bias and the counterintuitive nature of probability may lead to an overly optimistic interpretation of new evidence. Lack of detail complicates replicability.
