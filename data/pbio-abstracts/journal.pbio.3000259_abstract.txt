Hypotheses and theoretical frameworks are needed to organize and interpret the wealth of data on the organization of cortical networks in humans and animals in the light of development, evolution, and selective vulnerability to pathology. Goulas and colleagues compared several hypotheses of cortical network organization in 4 mammalian species and conclude that (1) the laminar pattern of cortico-cortical connections is better predicted by the Structural Model, which relates cytoarchitectonic differences of cortical areas to their interconnectedness, and (2) the existence of cortico-cortical connections is related to cytoarchitectonic differences and the physical distance between cortical areas. The predictions of the Structural Model can be applied to the human cortex, in which invasive studies are precluded. Goulas and colleagues advance interesting questions regarding the emergence of cortical structure and networks in development and evolution. Validated theories of cortical structure, development, and function can guide studies of cortical networks likely affected in neurodevelopmental disorders.
