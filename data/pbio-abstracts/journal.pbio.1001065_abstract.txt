Treatment of chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis (TB), requires a
                    remarkably long course of therapy, despite the availability of drugs that are
                    rapidly bacteriocidal in vitro. This observation has long been attributed to the
                    presence of bacterial populations in the host that are
                    “drug-tolerant” because of their slow replication and low rate of
                    metabolism. However, both the physiologic state of these hypothetical
                    drug-tolerant populations and the bacterial pathways that regulate growth and
                    metabolism in vivo remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that diverse
                    growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway in
                        Mycobacterium tuberculosis that leads to the induction of
                    triglyceride synthesis. This pathway plays a causal role in reducing growth and
                    antibiotic efficacy by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from the
                    tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mutants in which this metabolic switch is disrupted
                    are unable to arrest their growth in response to stress and remain sensitive to
                    antibiotics during infection. Thus, this regulatory pathway contributes to
                    antibiotic tolerance in vivo, and its modulation may represent a novel strategy
                    for accelerating TB treatment.
