In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model
          are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is
          evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies
          between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular
          clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of
          “relaxed phylogenetics.” Here we introduce a new approach to
          performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate
          phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and
          calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of
          datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no
          significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that
          autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place
          these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the
          alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61
          plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is
          phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while
          adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.
