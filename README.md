# Topic Modeling Course

This repository contains some basic code for the topic modeling course that I
taught at the Vienna Models & Methods summer school, July, 2022.

**I'm leaving this repository here, since it's a URL that some people may have
bookmarked, but [development on this notebook is continuing on
Codeberg,](https://codeberg.org/cpence/topic-modeling-tutorial) not here.**
